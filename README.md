# Catastrophic Love Story

I think the topic is barely understandable from the name...

Esirgün grew up in Moda, Kadıköy and lived a modern life. She was lost in the noise of the city. She was far from her family's traditional values. She found her place in this world where everything was changing rapidly. She worked as a tailor in Fatih and followed all the developments in the city. She tried to keep up with every innovation. Esirgün often spent time with her boyfriend, spent time with her friends in the trendiest places in the city. She had no fear for her future because she had control over everything. She had good relations with her family. Even the person she would marry was clear. She was in harmony with her childhood friend Mecit and her family knew about their relationship and everyone was sure that Mecit and Esirgün would get married one day. One day, while she was closing her shop, Esirgün coincidentally met a young man who had just moved to the city and was completely unfamiliar with modern life. This man's name was Haluk. He was very determined about his traditional values ​​and calm lifestyle. Esirgün was amazed by her personality that clung to a life that was slower than the city and was distant from the modern world. While Haluk defended the simplicity and peace of town life, Neriman found these thoughts strange.

Esirgün, who defended the modern world and fast life against Haluk, could not remain indifferent to his world. Haluk was a man who had escaped from the chaos of Moda and lived in deep thoughts. One day, Esirgün could not make sense of Haluk's stories about Fatih and decided to approach him. They started spending time together, but in Neriman's eyes, Haluk was still a stranger.

After 2-3 months, Esirgün started spending more time talking to Haluk than her boyfriend. She had started learning the simple life from Haluk and they had become very close friends.

One evening, Haluk made Neriman an offer. You should spend a week here in this town. Maybe you too can discover the meaning of leaving the city. You can realize that speed does not always bring you happiness.

Neriman thought about this offer for a while. she was bored with life, Esirgün found this offer attractive, Neriman finally accepted Haluk's proposal, they had already started to love each other despite their opposing views due to being exposed to each other, and after small arguments, even though the person she would marry was clear...
Esirgün chose Haluk, married him and went with him, she was living in Fatih, living a simple, almost village life, she had started working as a tailor there, her financial situation was bad but she felt happy, but there were people she had forgotten behind her...
Esirgün had also given up on her family, she had actually made a mistake, even though she loved this simple life and got used to it so quickly, she had not thought about what she had left behind, she had told Mecit that she had left him and left there, her family had left Esirgün alone in great shock.
After a long time, she went home to get news from her family, she had experienced the shock of her life when she received the news. Her mother had passed away due to stress and sadness, and Mecit could not stand the sadness she had experienced and killed himself. Esirgün was saying, "I wish I hadn't chosen Haluk", but his father was already very angry with Esirgün because of the choice he made. When Esirgün returned to Fatih, he couldn't stand the great remorse he felt and killed himself... All Esirgün left behind was a big Esirgün...
